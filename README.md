# ALX Curriculum Project - Setting Up Your Local Coding Environment

This repository is part of the ALX School curriculum project focusing on setting up a local coding environment using Ubuntu and various tools like Vagrant and Docker.

## Project Overview

The project's goal is to guide students through the setup of a local Ubuntu environment on different operating systems (Windows, macOS) using tools like WSL, Vagrant, and Docker. It emphasizes the importance of having a local environment for coding and learning purposes, enabling offline work and familiarity with Linux systems.

## Concepts Covered

- What is a virtual machine (VM) and its purpose.
- Introduction to Vagrant as a tool for managing virtual environments.
- Understanding Ubuntu as a Linux distribution.
- Basic usage of WSL on Windows and Docker for containerization.
- The significance of the `uname` command in Linux systems.

## Requirements

- Installation of Git for version control.
- Setting up a Git and GitHub account.
- Basic Git commands for repository management (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`).

## Project Structure

The project includes the following directories and files:

- `0x00-vagrant/README.md`: Detailed instructions for setting up an Ubuntu VM and understanding the `uname` command.
- Other directories for subsequent tasks and their respective README.md files.

## Usage

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone <repo_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `0x00-vagrant` directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd 0x00-vagrant
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in `README.md` to set up your Ubuntu VM and complete the task.

## Resources

- Virtual machine and its applications.
- `man uname` for detailed information about the `uname` command.
- Learning objectives about Vagrant and Ubuntu.
